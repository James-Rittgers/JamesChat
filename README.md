This project utilizes the python sockets module, a module which comes with the deafut implementation of CPython. You can just download and run!

Planned changes:
  - GUI for user friendliness (probably made with TKINTER)
  - Usernames
  - Server kick ability
  - exe release (for our non-python friends)
